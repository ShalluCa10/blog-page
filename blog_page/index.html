            <h1>My Youtube Content Creator Journey</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Shallu Sameera, a passionate YouTube content creator. I am from Punjab, India. I am an
                extrovert personality. A girl with too many goals. I love to travel and record amazing things in my

            <p> I would love to share my journey through this blog article. I created my first YouTube channel in 13
                June, 2020. On this day I tribute to my back home college founder <em> Spritual and Divine Soul <span>
                        Behan Devki Devi Jain</span>.</em> She is an inspiration to many girls she started school with 5
                girls in Ludhiana, Punjab in <em>1918</em>. I got opportunity to present her lifestory on her <b>116
                    birth anniversary.</b> in front of college president, cheif guest and more than 2000 audience. Media
                was there and they record my video and posted on news channel. On that I decided to show people about
                her biography and inspirational stories to those who wants to do something impactful in life. From that
                day I got an idea to become content creator to create knowledgeable content for YouTube.</p>
